## Roadmap

I've got a rough roadmap, but things can change depending on feedback.

I've got several different "chapters" -- loose groups of functionality. I'm not going to move
lineraly, but kind of jump around while making the videos. So there are two ways to view these:
In the order they were made, or in topic order. The rough topic order is below:

### Chapter 1: server / API development

* Express basics
* Deployment /configuration
* Database migrations
* Database interaction
* Testing
* Server-rendered React
* Authorization

### Chapter 2: Webapp

* React basics
* webpack config/hotloading
* CSS
* Main page
* Detail page
* Unit Testing
* E2E Testing
* Routing
* Redux
* Redux Devtools
* API Integration
* Client side authorization

### Chapter 3: Mobile App / React native

* React Native basics
* Android setup
* Testing
* Porting pages to react native
* IOS setup
* Platform differences

## The App

It's a simple master/detail view app to add and remove work contacts. This is not a particularly
complex app, but it's real enough that we can do some interesting stuff with it.

There are [mockups](doc/mockups) available.
